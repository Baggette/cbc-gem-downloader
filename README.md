# cbc-gem-downloader
A script made in python to download cbc gem content. <br>
You must edit example.env with the appropriate details and rename the file to .env<br>
Run pip install -r requirements.txt.<br>
run python gem.py and input the desired url and you should be set!!!!
ps, on windows you may encounter an error related to ffmpeg not being installed or something, you can place the ffmpeg exe in the same dir as the script and that will solve the issue (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
